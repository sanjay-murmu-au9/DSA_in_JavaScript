# BUBBLE SORT;
ELementary Sorting Algorithms
# What is sorting?
Sorting is  the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g an array) so that the items
	are in some kind of order.
Examples:-
	* Sorting numbers from smaller to largest;
	* Sorting names alphabetically
	* Sorting movies based on release year;
	* Sorting movies based on revenue;

# Why do we need to learn this?
	* Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works.
	* There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own
	advantages and disadvantages;

OBJectives
	1. Implement bubble sort
	2. Implement selection sort
	3. Implement insertion sort
	4. Understand why it is important to learn these simpler sorting algorithms;


let text = ['steel','Colt','Data Structures','Algorithms'];
console.log(text.sort()) // [ 'Algorithms', 'Colt', 'Data Structures', 'steel' ];

# sort text to compare by length; // ['Colt','steel', 'Algorithms','Data Structures'];
function compareByLen(str1,str2){ 
  return str1.length - str2.length;
}

console.log(text.sort(compareByLen)) // [ 'Colt', 'steel', 'Algorithms', 'Data Structures' ]

# [6,4,15,10] // sort in ascending

function numberCompare(num1,num2){
   return num1-num2
}

console.log([6,4,15,10].sort(numberCompare))//[4,6,10,15]

# Bubble Sort; A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top.

[5,3,4,1,2]
[3,4,1,2,5]
[3,1,2,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5]

Many sorting algorithms involve some type of swapping functionality (e.g. swapping to numbers to put them in order)
// ES5
function swap(arr,idx1,idx2){
  let temp = arr[idx1];
  arr[idx1] = arr[idx2];
  arr[idx2] = temp;
}

//ES2015
const swap = (arr,idx1,idx2) =>{
  [arr[idx1],arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];// take idx1 and swap it with idx2; idx2 swap with idx1;
}


Bubble Sort Pseudocode
	* Start looping with a variable called i the end of the array towards the begining;
	* Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning untill i-1;
	* If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two values!
	* Return the sorted array;

function bubbleSort(arr){
  for(let i=arr.length;i > 0;i--){
	for(let j = 0;j<i-1;j++){
       console.log(arr,arr[j],arr[j+1]);
       if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]){
         let temp = arr[j];
	    arr[j] = arr[j+1];
	    arr[j+1] = temp;
        } 
      }
     console.log('ONE PASS COMPLETE!')
   }
   return arr;
}

console.log(bubbleSort([5,3,4,1,2])) // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
